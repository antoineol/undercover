# DDD Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully restructured the codebase from a technical-role-based organization to a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, organizing code by business domains and features rather than technical concerns.

## New Architecture

### Domain Structure

```
src/domains/
├── game/                    # Game logic and win conditions
│   ├── entities/
│   │   └── player.ts
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── game-logic.service.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── room/                    # Room management and game state
│   ├── entities/
│   │   └── room.ts
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── room-management.service.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── player/                  # Player management and role assignment
│   ├── entities/
│   │   └── player.ts
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── role-assignment.service.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── configuration/           # Game rules and configuration
│   ├── entities/
│   │   └── game-config.ts
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── game-config.service.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── ui/                      # UI display and formatting
│   ├── entities/
│   │   └── display.ts
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── ui-helpers.service.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── validation/              # Input validation and game state validation
│   ├── entities/
│   │   └── validation.ts
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── validation.service.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── utilities/               # Common utility functions
│   ├── entities/
│   │   └── utilities.ts
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── utilities.service.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── index.ts                 # Main domain exports
```

### Test Structure

```
tests/domains/
├── game/
│   └── game-logic.test.ts
├── room/
│   └── room-management.test.ts
├── player/
│   └── role-assignment.test.ts
├── configuration/
│   └── game-config.test.ts
└── ui/
    └── ui-helpers.test.ts
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Domain Separation

- **Game Domain**: Core game logic, win conditions, voting mechanics
- **Room Domain**: Room state management, game flow, turn management
- **Player Domain**: Player management, role assignment, player actions
- **Configuration Domain**: Game rules, validation, setup
- **UI Domain**: Presentation helpers, display formatting
- **Validation Domain**: Input validation, game state validation
- **Utilities Domain**: Common utility functions

### 2. Clean Architecture

- Each domain has clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Entities define the core business objects
- Services contain pure business logic functions
- Clean separation between domains with minimal coupling

### 3. Import Updates

- Updated all imports throughout the codebase to use new domain structure
- React components now import from `@/domains/*` instead of `@/lib/pure/*`
- Service files updated to use domain imports

### 4. Test Migration

- Migrated all tests to match new domain structure
- Tests are now organized by domain rather than technical function
- All 125 tests passing successfully

## Benefits

### 1. Better Organization

- Code is now organized by business domain rather than technical role
- Easier to understand and navigate for developers
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Improved Maintainability

- Changes to a business domain are contained within that domain
- Easier to locate and modify related functionality
- Reduced coupling between different parts of the system

### 3. Enhanced Testability

- Tests are organized by domain, making it easier to find and maintain
- Clear test boundaries that match business boundaries
- Better test coverage and organization

### 4. Scalability

- New features can be added within appropriate domains
- Easy to extend functionality without affecting other domains
- Clear patterns for adding new business logic

## Migration Process

1. **Analysis**: Identified domain boundaries and business features
2. **Design**: Created DDD-based directory structure
3. **Migration**: Moved functions to appropriate domains
4. **Updates**: Updated all imports throughout the codebase
5. **Testing**: Migrated and updated all test files
6. **Cleanup**: Removed old structure and unused files

## Results

- ✅ All 125 tests passing
- ✅ Clean domain separation
- ✅ Improved code organization
- ✅ Better maintainability
- ✅ Enhanced scalability
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

The refactoring successfully transformed the codebase from a technical-role-based structure to a clean, domain-driven architecture that better reflects the business logic and improves maintainability.
